# ConnectFour

Play connect 4 against a bot

Simply import the project into eclipse and hit play!

This project was created using test driven development.

The bot was designed to be aggressive and end games quickly.

It IS beatable, but not with ease.

It will force you to play reactive and cannot lose without dragging the game out to the last column
(even then it will mostly win).
